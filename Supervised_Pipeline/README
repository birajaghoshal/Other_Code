PIPELINE PLAN

Classification:

	- Input: Dataset, Labels, OPTIONAL (sample names, feature names)
	- Run many iterations (parallel, multiprocessor) of cross-validation to determine best method
	- 

	Maybe get input of train vs test

	- Output: Performance of different methods (ordered) then predictions for test data if exists
		- Make different kinds of plots. 

IDEA: make it easy + fast to test a bunch of methods simultaneously (example Kaggle challenge or my data)

DO the same for regression
