This repo is for storing miscellaneous code that I've written.

### Reinforcement_Learning

My implementations of model-free and model-based RL methods. The model is DKF/DVAE. 

### VAE 

Experiments involving VAEs. I compared VAE to IWAE. I examined the how well VAEs could model multimodal distributions. I looked how the structure of the VAE affects its performance. 

### Sequence_Learning

Early implementation of the DKF/DVAE, which is a VAE model for sequential data.

### Sampling 
My implementations of various sampling methods.

### Normalizing_Flows
My implementation of Normalizing Flows. Didnt not work too well.

### Variational_Inference

Autograd examples of SVI 

### IW_MoG_AE

Importance Weighted Mixture of Gaussians Autoencoder

### Probabilistic_modelling

My implementations of various methods including Gibbs sampling, Collapsed Gibbs, and DPGMMs. 


### Biased_Sampling 

Analyzed how to deal with datasets that had unbalanced classes in an online and unsupervised setting. 

###Hockey_Predictions 

Some code I used to make predictions for drafting in the hockey pool.

### CSC2508 

Database Course Project - University of Toronto Argo is an automated mapping layer that runs on top of a traditional RDBMS, and presents the JSON data model directly to the application/user. Argo has been previously shown to have a significant speedup over document-oriented databases, specifically MongoDB. This was shown by evaluating the systems using the benchmark NoBench. This benchmark evaluates queries on relatively simple JSON documents. Therefore, in order to gain a more comprehensive assessment of Argo, I extended the NoBench data to include more complex data, such as highly nested objects and arrays with more elements. Here I show that increasing the complexity of the data reduces the speedup that Argo has over MongoDB.


### Code_for_plotting

Code I used to make plots in Python using Matplotlib. 


### Python_Packets

Python code to send and receive messages (packets)
Used during the summer of 2014 to test packet throughput


### animation 

Plan to write code to vizulize neural net training. 

### comp250

McGill Course

The code I wrote for some of the assignments in this course. (Java)

### comp251

McGill Course

The code I wrote for some of the assignments in this course. (Java)


### multicore

Examples on how to use the Python multiprocessing packages

### neural_net

Neural Net code that I modified from Michael Nielson

### regression_intuition

Basic examples to help me gain some intuition about regression


### simulated_data

Samples from Gaussian distribution and Uniform distribution. Choose number of features and samples. Choose number of features that are distinct between classes.
