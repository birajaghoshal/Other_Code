###CSC2508 

Database Course Project - University of Toronto Argo is an automated mapping layer that runs on top of a traditional RDBMS, and presents the JSON data model directly to the application/user. Argo has been previously shown to have a significant speedup over document-oriented databases, specifically MongoDB. This was shown by evaluating the systems using the benchmark NoBench. This benchmark evaluates queries on relatively simple JSON documents. Therefore, in order to gain a more comprehensive assessment of Argo, I extended the NoBench data to include more complex data, such as highly nested objects and arrays with more elements. Here I show that increasing the complexity of the data reduces the speedup that Argo has over MongoDB.


##Code_for_plotting

Code I used to make plots in Python using Matplotlib. 


###HGvLG

Bladder cancer are graded based on how differentiated the cells are. Here is the code I wrote to predict grade from gene expressions. I also cluster the samples and analyze the results. 


###Python_Packets

Python code to send and receive messages (packets)
Used during the summer of 2014 to test packet throughput


###animation 

Plan to write code to vizulize neural net training. 

###comp250

McGill Course

The code I wrote for some of the assignments in this course. (Java)

###comp251

McGill Course

The code I wrote for some of the assignments in this course. (Java)

###find_metastatic_TCGA

Code I used to predict metastatic tumours from TCGA data

###multicore

Examples on how to use the Python multiprocessing packages

###neural_net

Neural Net code that I modified from Michael Nielson

###recurrence_predictor

Code I used to predict tumour recurrence

###regression_intuition

Basic examples to help me gain some intuition about regression


###simulated_data

Samples from Gaussian distribution and Uniform distribution. Choose number of features and samples. Choose number of features that are distinct between classes.
