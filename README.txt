Database Course Project - University of Toronto Argo is an automated mapping layer that runs on top of a traditional RDBMS, and presents the JSON data model directly to the application/user. Argo has been previously shown to have a significant speedup over document-oriented databases, specifically MongoDB. This was shown by evaluating the systems using the benchmark NoBench. This benchmark evaluates queries on relatively simple JSON documents. Therefore, in order to gain a more comprehensive assessment of Argo, I extended the NoBench data to include more complex data, such as highly nested objects and arrays with more elements. Here I show that increasing the complexity of the data reduces the speedup that Argo has over MongoDB.

Bladder cancer are graded based on how differentiated the cells are. Here is the code I wrote to predict grade from gene expressions. I also cluster the samples and analyze the results.
